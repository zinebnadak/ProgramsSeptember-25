#The game TwentyOne!
# The game is played by receiving one card at a time, and the player decides whether to take additional cards or not.
# The goal is to get the total card value as close to 21 as possible without going over.
# Aces are counted as either 1 or 14.
# card faces already represent their value 2-10
# Jacks (11), Queens (12) and Kings (13) are all worth 10 points
# If a player exceeds 21, they lose. In this example, a game is simulated between a human player and the computer.
# One card is dealt at a time, and after each round, if the player or the computer ends up with more than 21 points, they are considered to have lost.
# If both the player and the computer have less than 21 points, the one with the higher score wins.
# The computer always wins in case of a tie.
